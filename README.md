Difficulty tracking spending trends over time
Inability to forecast future expenses
SpendGenie solves this by providing data-driven insights and predictions, empowering users to make informed financial decisions.

Track Expenses: Categorize expenses from CSV uploads or manual input.
Analyze Spending Patterns: Summarize expenses by category and time periods.
Predict Future Expenses: Estimate upcoming costs using historical averages.
Interactive Dashboard: Provide an intuitive interface for quick analysis.

Architecture & Workflow

Conceptual Flow
CSV Upload / Manual Entry → Data Normalization → Category Aggregation → Display Totals
                                               → Average Calculation → Predictive Estimate

Technical Architecture

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Flask templates for UI and forms
Backend: Flask routes handle data processing, aggregation, and prediction
Data Handling: Pandas for normalization, aggregation, filtering, and calculations
Deployment: ngrok exposes Flask server publicly from Google Colab
